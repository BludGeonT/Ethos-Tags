# Ethos-Tags - User Interface (UI)

- Go through the ```PLANNING.md``` file first to get guidelines and guardrails set up
- Go through the ```README.md``` file second to understand Ethos-Tags Module in full
- Go through this ```UI.md``` file to understand what the UI goals are and what the layout should look like.

#### Ethos-Tags Startup
- When someone clicks on the Ethos-Tags link on the left of the main page, it will open up a whole new page just just Ethos-OCR does.

#### Ethos-Tags Screen Elements
We will want a few different sections on the screen displayed.
  - A Tag Management Section containing the following buttons to click
    - Create New Tag
    - Edit A Tag
    - Delete A Tag
  - A display section for all saved tags in the database to be displayed nicely
  - A reporting section (we will build this at a later time in its own module)
