# Ethos-Tags

#### Ethos-Tags Needs
We need to create a tagging system for items stored in the EthosProject Databases.  For example, Ethos-OCR has a database full of screenshots of spam, scams, hackers, fraud, illegal weapon sales, drugs, etc.  These records contain data that will be used by the EthosProject ecosystem and what will make this very organized an manageable is to create a tagging module where calassifications of data can be assigned to records.  

##### Some examples will be:
- ```FRAUD```
- ```WEAPONS```
- ```DRUGS```
- ```CRYPTO```
- ```TRAFFICKING```
- ```SCAM```
- ```TERRORISM```
